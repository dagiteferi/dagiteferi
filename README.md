                                                   - 👋 Hi, I’m @dagiteferi


I learned about programming for the first time when my ICT explained to me how coding is used in software. But in high school, when I developed numerous websites using HTML, CSS, and JS and systems using C++, that's when I really realized it was my passion . I made the decision to educate myself. Now that numerous online courses and numerous real-world projects have been accomplished.
